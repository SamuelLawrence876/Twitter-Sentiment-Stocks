## Project Intro
In an attempt to understand the voice of investors, this project seeks to understand the contextual language used on specific stocks. (Tesla in this example) 

### Methods Used
* Natural Processing Language
* Data lemmatization/stemming
* Data Tokenization
* Data Visualization
* Predictive Modeling

### Technologies
* Python
* GetOldTweets3
* Pandas, jupyter
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Nltk
* Wordcloud 
* Text Blob
* yfinance

## Project Objectives
As people tweet about stocks on a daily scale, some things we hoped to discover included:

- What is the overall sentiment of a particular stock?
- Is the overall sentiment correlated to the stock price in anyway?
- What positions do people on average towards the stock?

    ### things to note:

* The tweets were curated using GetOldTweets3. Twitter's API wasn't used as we found it to be very limited in its capabilities as a free user. This project does open up the question to what the sentiment is like on a grand scale.
* This analysis was dont one 8000 tweets

## Key findings
- People overall are very bullish about tesla's stock. However, there is a level of skepticism about how far the stock can climb given the current valuation.
- Most common words included: Call, Split, nice, wow, crazy
